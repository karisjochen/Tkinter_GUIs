# Tkinter_GUIs
A Repository hosting various apps I have created for the user to interact with the backend python script.

- app 1: Weather GUI requesting the user input a location and returning a graph displaying the next 7 days of expected high and low temperatures.
- app 2: Stock app requesting a ticker symbol from the user and returning current stock data and the option to switch between 3 different graphs.
